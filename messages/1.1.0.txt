Virtualenv 1.1.0
================

- Fixed an issue where virtualenvs that were in the root folder of the currently opened folders
  in sublime text were not being found when searching through virtualenv_directories.  It would
  search all subdirectories of window.folders(), but not the root folders themselves.
  For example, assuming a folder structure like this:
    C:\CODE\MY_PROJECT
    │   main.py
    │   requirements.txt
    │
    ├───Include
    │     <FILES>
    │
    ├───Lib
    │     <FILES>
    │
    └───Scripts
          activate
          activate.bat
          Activate.ps1
          pip.exe
          python.exe

  Where the MY_PROJECT folder is the folder opened in sublime text.
  Previously it would generate a path to the activate script with os.join(BINDIR, ACTIVATE_SCRIPT).
  On Windows that would create the string "Scripts\activate.bat".  Then it would iterate through
  each subdirectory checking for the existence of that file. In this example it would generate the
  following absolute file paths and run them against os.path.isfile()
    C:\CODE\MY_PROJECT\Include\Scripts\activate.bat
    C:\CODE\MY_PROJECT\Lib\Scripts\activate.bat
    C:\CODE\MY_PROJECT\Scripts\Scripts\activate.bat
  All of these would fail and it would find the virtualenv.  If it also checked the root folder the
  generated list would include
    C:\CODE\MY_PROJECT\Scripts\activate.bat
  Which would have found the virtualenv and worked as expected.
